- we test to see what an object is , not what it does
  because maybe today it does this, but tmr business changes, it does that
  so we cannot depend on what it does, but what it is
- Cucumber(outer cycle) used to describe the behavior of application
- RSpec(inner cycle) used to describe the behavior of object
- HOW
  #1 write failing step (cucumber) outer cycle
  #2 get the step to pass
  #3 write RSpec to drive code
